# hello-world

Hello out there!

Firstly, I think long sushi lunches while programming 
is productive, healthy, and relaxing.  Especially with 
miso soup and green tea while I think.

I enjoy C++ and OOP and OOD very much.  As well as Python.
Hoping to do something in the field of AI very soon!
But first, I want to learn more about the basics of machine
learning, which is why I am so happy to be here!
